        | Folders are an important part for understanding application architecture.  Folders help provide organizational clarity.  Some Folder structures can even hint / indicate a Web Framework, Technology or implementation strategy.

      .example
        pre.prettyprint.linenums.
          # java files (controllers, models)
          /Java Resources/src

          # decorator files

      p
        | There are some key files that control the application's configuration. It is crucial that you understand what they are for and how they effect your development.

      .example
        pre.prettyprint.linenums.
          # application descriptor/core
          web.xml

          # application configurations
          struts-default.xml

          # plugins
          struts-plugins.xml

          # application configuration overrides
          struts.properties

          # decorator intercepter
          sitemesh.xml

          # database connection
          server.xml

          # routing file
          struts.xml

          # decorator file
          decorators.xml

    section#css
      h1 CSS

      .alert-box.info.radius(data-alert)
        | <strong>BETA</strong> This section is currently under development.

      p
        | CSS is used to style the markup or HTML that is generated by <code>View Templates</code> and <code>Partial Templates</code>.  <strong>It is important to note that we do not write CSS in our application, instead we write SASS (Using Compass).</strong>

      .example
        pre.prettyprint.linenums.
          # font-awesome and textual based icons
          /css/font

          # files that are created by 3rd party companies, such as twitter bootstrap and font awesome.
          /css/vendor/*

          # a compiled version of the applications custom styles
          /css/pics.css

          # a compile version of the applications styles
          /css/style.css

    section#javascript
      h1 Javascript

      .alert-box.info.radius(data-alert)
        | <strong>BETA</strong> This section is currently under development.

      p
        | Javascript is used to unobtrusively add sophisticated functionality to our HTML.  Javascript should not control page layout or styles.  Those jobs are better suited for Templates and CSS.  Javascript can and should be used for adding interaction to a web application or to fetch "extra" data asynchronously.

      .example
        pre.prettyprint.linenums.
          # extjs application for dynamic reports
          js/extjs

          # custom application interaction
          js/pics

          # files that are created by 3rd party companies, such as twitter bootstrap and jquery.
          js/vendor

          # a compile version of the applications javascript
          js/script.js

    section#extjs
      h1 ExtJS

      .alert-box.info.radius(data-alert)
        | <strong>BETA</strong> This section is currently under development.

      p
        | ExtJS4 is a large <code>MV*</code> Javascript framework that is used for Dynamic Reports.  ExtJS4 works very different from the typical web stack.  It is responsible for page layout, interaction and styles, but also handles client side database storage.

      .example
        pre.prettyprint.linenums.
          # extjs application for dynamic reports
          js/extjs/pics

          # extjs source files + custom compliations
          js/extjs/pics/extjs

          # application files
          js/extjs/pics/app

          # application runner
          app.js

          # application instructions
          js/extjs/pics/README

          # application deployment
          app.jsb3
          index.html
          prod.html

          # application resources
          js/extjs/pics/resources
